# 2D Shooter Game with Boosters and Waves

This is a fun, interactive 2D shooter game created with Python and Pygame. In this game, players control a character that can move left and right, shoot at enemies, collect boosters, and progress through increasingly challenging waves of enemies. The game includes power-ups like a triple shot and a bomb, adding extra excitement to the gameplay!

## Features

- **Enemies & Waves**: Enemies spawn in waves, each becoming progressively harder. Defeat all enemies in a wave to advance to the next one.
- **Power-Ups**: Collect boosters for special abilities:
  - **Triple Shot**: Fires three bullets in a spread pattern for 10 seconds.
  - **Bomb**: Destroys all enemies on screen when it hits any enemy.
- **Score Tracking**: Earn points for each enemy defeated, and view your score after each game.
- **Responsive Controls**: Fast-paced movement and shooting mechanics, optimized for smooth gameplay.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/2D-shooter-game.git
   cd 2D-shooter-game
   ```

2. Install Pygame:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. Run the game:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Play

- **Move**: Use the `LEFT` and `RIGHT` arrow keys to move.
- **Shoot**: Hold the `SPACEBAR` to shoot bullets continuously.
- **Bomb**: When a bomb power-up is collected, the next shot will be a bomb. 
- **Triple Shot**: When a triple shot power-up is collected, you’ll shoot in a spread pattern for 10 seconds.
- **Play Again**: When you lose, click the "Play Again" button to restart the game.

## Code Highlights

- **Boosters**: Randomly spawned power-ups make gameplay more dynamic.
- **Wave Mechanics**: Each wave increases enemy count and speed, adding difficulty.
- **Game Over Screen**: Displays score and allows restarting.

## About Me

I love creating random, fun projects to learn more about coding and game development. This project was a great way to explore Pygame’s capabilities while adding my own touch with unique boosters and gameplay mechanics.

## Future Improvements

- Add more power-ups for additional gameplay variety.
- Implement high score tracking.
- Add new enemy types and bosses to enhance the challenge.
